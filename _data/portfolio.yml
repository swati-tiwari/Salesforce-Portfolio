  code: https://github.com/crowddj/crowddj-react
  description: Crowd DJ is a web app that allows people who are at a party or social gathering with a DJ (who uses Spotify) to request songs via their smartphones. The web app allows people to see the currently playing song, request songs, upvote songs, and rate songs so the DJ can see how the crowd is feeling and act accordingly. In other words, Crowd DJ is essentially a crowdsourced music queue.

#   description: A simple weather app I made at HubSpot's Fall 2016 Web App Workshop utilizing Node.js, Express, and Heroku. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather and forecast data, and then used the current city's coordinates to create a map background that reflected the current city using the Google Maps API.

  description: ScreenTime 2.0 was one of <a href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>'s most important consumer-facing software updates on <a href="https://starry.com/station" target="_blank">Starry Station</a>, providing new functionality for users to easily filter content, pause the internet, and even create custom rules for blocking apps like Facebook and Twitter right from their mobile phones. As a co-op, I played a large role in the implementation of this feature on Starry's cordova android app, and was responsible for building out front-end designs, linking up back-end data, as well as communicating with designers and other engineers throughout the process. <br><br> Check out the Starry App on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starry.management" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, and learn more about ScreenTime 2.0 on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/screentime-for-starry-station" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> and the <a href="https://blog.starry.com/whats-new-screentime-just-got-better-for-parents/" target="_blank">Starry Blog</a>.

  description: This is just an online version of my resume I made for fun. I was interested in learning React.js, so I found this <a href="https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq">simple tutorial</a> and it kind of spun into this weekend project. I probably didn't need to use React at all, but hey, at least I learned a few things!

  description: This was my first portfolio website I built in 2014. It's a simple one-pager like this one, but relied heavily on Bootstrap. Since then, I think my web development and design skills have expanded immensely.

  demo: http://onecardforall.org
  description: At MullenLowe, I helped build this 2015 holiday site around an algorithm that generated a holiday greeting to each and every person on the planet. We also accounted for newcomers being added at an amazing rate. Overall, the website is a tranquil, animated experience. As new names appear, visitors can watch them fall, like snowflakes, onto a stylized world map. Users can also find their own name and see it as part of the world collective. Check out this short <a href="http://us.mullenlowe.com/work/one-card-for-all/" target="_blank">video</a> describing the project!
